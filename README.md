# VoteLedger 🗳️

A beginner-friendly, secure, and transparent blockchain voting system built with Solidity and Ethereum.

## What is VoteLedger?

VoteLedger is a smart contract-based voting system that demonstrates fundamental blockchain concepts:

- **Immutability**: Once cast, votes cannot be changed or deleted
- **Transparency**: Anyone can verify the vote counts on-chain
- **Trustlessness**: No central authority controls the election
- **Security**: Built-in protections against common attack vectors

> ⚠️ **Important**: This is NOT an anonymous voting system. All votes are publicly visible on the blockchain. This is intentional for learning purposes and suitable for scenarios like DAO governance or public polls.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18+ installed
- Basic understanding of Ethereum and smart contracts
- MetaMask or similar wallet (for interacting with deployed contracts)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd VoteLedger

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Compile the Contract

```bash
npm run compile
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with gas reporting
npm run test:gas
```

### Deploy Locally

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start local blockchain
npm run node

# Terminal 2: Deploy contract
npm run deploy:local
```

## Key Features

### 1. One Vote Per Address
Each Ethereum address can only vote once. Attempting to vote twice results in a revert.

### 2. Fixed Voting Period
The voting deadline is set at deployment and cannot be changed. Votes after the deadline are rejected.

### 3. Immutable Votes
Once cast, votes cannot be modified or deleted. This ensures election integrity.

### 4. Transparent Results
Anyone can query the current vote counts at any time. After the deadline, anyone can see the winner.

### 5. No Owner Privileges
The deployer has no special powers after deployment. They cannot:
- Add or remove candidates
- Extend or shorten the voting period
- Modify vote counts
- Censor voters

## How to Use

### As a Voter

1. Connect your wallet to the network where the contract is deployed
2. Call `vote(candidateId)` with the ID of your chosen candidate
3. Confirm the transaction in your wallet
4. Your vote is now permanently recorded!

### As an Observer

1. Call `getAllResults()` to see all candidates and their vote counts
2. Call `isVotingActive()` to check if voting is still open
3. After the deadline, call `getWinner()` to see the winner

## Interview Talking Points

When discussing this project in an interview, you can highlight:

### Design Decisions

1. **Why `mapping` for voters instead of array?**
   - O(1) lookup vs O(n) search
   - Prevents double voting efficiently
   - More gas efficient

2. **Why custom errors instead of require strings?**
   - Gas savings (~200-500 gas per error)
   - Better developer experience with structured errors
   - More readable in debugging tools

3. **Why `block.timestamp` for deadline?**
   - Simple and readable
   - Accurate enough for voting periods
   - Known limitation: miners can manipulate by ~15 seconds (acceptable trade-off)

4. **Why no upgradeability?**
   - Adds complexity and trust assumptions
   - For voting, immutability is a feature, not a bug
   - Users can verify the code won't change

### Security Measures

1. **Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**: State changes happen before any external calls
2. **Input validation**: All candidate IDs are bounds-checked
3. **No re-entrancy risk**: No external calls in critical functions
4. **No owner abuse**: Deployer has zero privileges after deployment

### Known Limitations

1. **No privacy**: All votes are public
2. **No Sybil resistance**: One person can create many wallets
3. **Fixed candidates**: Cannot add/remove after deployment
4. **Gas costs**: Each vote costs ~60,000 gas

## Future Improvements

If you wanted to extend this project, consider:

1. **Commit-Reveal Scheme**: Hide votes until the deadline for privacy
2. **Delegation**: Allow users to delegate their votes
3. **Weighted Voting**: Integrate with ERC-20 tokens
4. **Post-Quantum Signatures**: For long-term security
5. **Off-Chain Voting**: Use EIP-712 signatures for gasless voting
